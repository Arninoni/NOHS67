                <p>
                    Negros Occidental High School (NOHS) was established to provide quality
                    education to students in Bacolod City. Over the years, the school has
                    grown into one of the most respected public high schools in the region.
                </p>

                <h2>Growth and Development</h2>
                <p>
                    Through decades of dedication, NOHS expanded its programs,
                    improved facilities, and introduced various academic strands
                    such as STEM, ABM, HUMSS, and TVL.
