                <h2>Our Beginnings</h2>
                <p>Negros Occidental High School (NOHS) in Bacolod City is the oldest public secondary school in Negros Occidental and one of the earliest provincial high schools in the Philippines. Established in 1902 as Instituto Rizal, it began with 125 students and three teachers under Principal Ray Howell. Despite early challenges, including a cholera outbreak and later the Japanese occupation during World War II, the school continued to grow and became known as the provincial high school.

The school was renamed several times—Rizal Institute in 1913 and Negros Occidental General Comprehensive High School in 1970—before its original name, Negros Occidental High School, was restored in 1983 after strong support from students and alumni. Today, NOHS remains a leading public high school offering Junior and Senior High School programs with various academic and technical tracks. With over a century of service and recognition as a historic institution, it continues to provide quality education and shape future generations.</p>

                <p>Modern Era and Name Changes (1948–Present)

Here's the shortened version of each bullet:

* *1948*: To address congestion at NOHS, *Bacolod City High School* was established to serve city residents independently, easing overcrowding and managing the growing student population.

* *1970*: The school was renamed *Negros Occidental General Comprehensive High School (NOGCHS)* by *Republic Act 5694*, but the change faced strong opposition from alumni who felt it erased the school’s original identity, leading to legal disputes.

* *1983*: After a decade-long legal battle, *Batas Pambansa Blg. 2193* restored the original name, *Negros Occidental High School (NOHS)*, a victory for alumni who sought to preserve the school’s legacy.

* *2002*: NOHS celebrated its *Centennial Anniversary*, and a *historical marker* was installed by the *National Historical Institute* to recognize the school’s contributions to education in Bacolod and Negros Occidental.

* *2016*: NOHS implemented the *Senior High School (SHS)* program under the K-12 reform, offering specialized tracks such as *STEM, ABM, HUMSS*, and *TVL*.</p>

                <h2>The Rise</h2>
                <p>Founded in 1902 by Antonio Ledesma Jayme and Melecio Severino, *Instituto Rizal* was established to bring secondary education to Occidental Negros. With support from Division Superintendent George W. Beattie, the school became a pioneering institution in Bacolod, quickly rising as a symbol of academic excellence.

In 1912, the school was renamed *Rizal Institute* following Executive Order No. 44, which made English the official language of the Philippines. This rebranding reflected the evolving national identity and the school’s commitment to educational standards of the time.

Today, the institution is known as *Negros Occidental High School (NOHS)*, continuing its legacy of innovation and growth. Guided by American principals until 1935, NOHS remains a beacon of progress in the Philippines' educational landscape, blending over a century of tradition with a focus on academic achievement.</p>
