                <h2>Our Beginnings</h2>
                <p>Negros Occidental High School (NOHS) in Bacolod City is the oldest public secondary school in Negros Occidental and one of the earliest provincial high schools in the Philippines. Established in 1902 as Instituto Rizal, it began with 125 students and three teachers under Principal Ray Howell. Despite early challenges, including a cholera outbreak and later the Japanese occupation during World War II, the school continued to grow and became known as the provincial high school.

The school was renamed several times—Rizal Institute in 1913 and Negros Occidental General Comprehensive High School in 1970—before its original name, Negros Occidental High School, was restored in 1983 after strong support from students and alumni. Today, NOHS remains a leading public high school offering Junior and Senior High School programs with various academic and technical tracks. With over a century of service and recognition as a historic institution, it continues to provide quality education and shape future generations.</p>

                <p>

in 1927, the permanent high school building was constructed at the present site. The construction was finished about 1931. When classes were transferred to the newly constructed building in September 1931, the name inscribed in the building facade read, "Bacolod High School". This was because in the public works program under the Appropriations Act of 1927, the name appearing was: "the construction of the Bacolod High School". However, the name was never officially used, instead the name Negros Occidental High School was used in all communications. NOGCHS In 1970, NOHS was drastically changed to Negros Occidental General comprehensive High School (NOGCHS) by virtue of R.A. 5694, series of 1970. It was passed in Congress without proper consultations from the students and alumni. Enraged, the school alumni lead the legal battle to change it.</p>

                <p>Modern Era and Name Changes (1948–Present)

                   In 1948, to address congestion at NOHS, Bacolod City High School was established to serve city residents independently, easing overcrowding and managing the growing student population. In 1970, the school was renamed Negros Occidental General Comprehensive High School (NOGCHS) by Republic Act 5694, but the change faced strong opposition from alumni who felt it erased the school’s original identity, leading to legal disputes. By 1983, after a decade-long legal battle, Batas Pambansa Blg. 2193 restored the original name, Negros Occidental High School (NOHS), marking a victory for alumni who sought to preserve the school’s legacy. In 2002, NOHS celebrated its Centennial Anniversary, and a historical marker was installed by the National Historical Institute to recognize the school’s contributions to education in Bacolod and Negros Occidental. Finally, in 2016, NOHS implemented the Senior High School (SHS) program under the K–12 reform, offering specialized tracks such as STEM, ABM, HUMSS, and TVL.</p>
